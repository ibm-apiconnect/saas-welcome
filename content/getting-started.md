## Sample API guide
To help you get started right away, we provide you with a sample API, in app guided tour,  as well as step by step documentation to help you create, test, secure and analyze your API in only a few minutes.

[Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQXiiIXY0vU) and follow along with the [step by step tutorial](https://github.com/ibm-apiconnect/sample-orders-api)

## Analyzing your APIs
To get a better understanding of the built in analytics including dashboards, filtering and search capabilities take a quick video tour.

Alongside the built in analytics there are options to offload data to an external service to perform a more holistic data search, view custom visualizations, and retain the analytics data for longer periods of time.  Our documentation provides examples for doing this with Amazon S3 and Splunk.

## Socializing your APIs via a customized Developer Portal 
Sharing your APIs with application developers is quick and easy using a customized Developer Portal.  
Our documentation covers everything from understanding initial concepts to guided tutorials for creating and customizing your portal. Alternatively, you can watch a video covering the key capabilities. 

[Watch a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qpShpXtz-Q&list=PL_4RxtD-BL5vnqTh3YXwLkap_P4oW-MSy&index=13) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=developer-portal-socialize-your-apis)

## Advanced capabilities
Once you’ve explored the basics you may be interested in several other features. We’ve highlighted a few below and can also take you through these and many more by [booking a live demo](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=DEMO-apiconnect).

{{<icon icon="AWSLambda">}} 
## AWS Lambda Integration
Route and protect your AWS Lambda Functions via a Gateway Policy that simplifies routing to backend serverless endpoints securely and authenticated. This compliments our existing support for gateway routing to application endpoints hosted on traditional EC2 instances and those running in containers on EKS and ROSA services on AWS.

## Automate API Test generation
Save time and improve API quality using AI enabled smart test generation to rapidly automate the creation of API Tests.

[Watch a video](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/swetha-sridharan1/2022/12/14/api-test-creation-in-seconds-using-smart-generatio) or [read the documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/saas?topic=started-creating-test)

## Create mock API responses using message template policies
Iterate faster without waiting on back end systems when designing APIs by using a built-in policy to create mock API responses. Building on the getting started tutorial this video shows you how to extend the sample API with conditional logic, mock responses and how to debug problems.
